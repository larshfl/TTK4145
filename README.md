# Gruppe 1 - Sanntidsprogrammering TTK4145 - Vår 2019

## Qucik start 
### Run elevator on the hardware used at "sanntidslabben"
```ruby 
$ ./startWithSafety.sh <port number>
```

## Intro


## System descripton? Should we have the flow diagram here?


## Code inspiration
We have used several modules written by @klasbo.

The driver module is mainly based on https://github.com/TTK4145/driver-go/tree/master/elevio<br />
Changes: structs and consts have been renamed and moved to types


The network module uses conn, bcast, localip and peers. These are almost an exact copy of https://github.com/TTK4145/Network-go/tree/master/network<br />
Changes:

The statemachine is inspired by Anders Petersens (@klasbo) lecture https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6YoNYNC7o4&t=1646s where he used a statemachine written in go as a visual aid. The elevator system design differs, but the structure have similarities.


## Legg også inn om vi har lånt kode fra nettet - Kan få problem med plagiat om vi har "lånt" kode uten å gi credit 

## Skriv readme til kvar av modulane

## Legg in bilde av flyskjema for tolatsystemet og for nettwork

## Testing
The development of this elevator system required lots of immaculate testing. We used the simulator written by @Klasbon as the main test environment. The simulator is available in this repository [SimElevator](https://github.com/TTK4145-students-2019/project-group-1/blob/master/SimElevatorServer). 

In order to make testing with multiples computers as smooth as possible we're using SSH to get access multiple computers. After a connection is established we run a shell script. That checks if a folder Gruppe1 exists on the Desktop and if the repo exisits in that folder the repo will be deleted and the latets version will be cloned


## Connect with SSH



### Preparations on linux based server
```ruby 
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install openssh-server
```
**Check if SSH service is running**
```ruby 
$ sudo systemctl status ssh
```

**Start or stop SSH service**
```ruby 
$ sudo systemctl start ssh
$ sudo systemctl stop ssh
```

**To obtain the servers ip adress**
```ruby 
$ ip a
```
Use the inet ip adress. See the picture for assitance

### Connect to server through SSH
```ruby 
$ server_username@ip -Y 
```
The -Y flag enables display on the server

### Troubleshooting 
Make sure that server has open policy. Check if policys are listed as ACCPETED by running
```ruby 
$ sudo iptables -L
```
Change the status with
```ruby 
$ iptables --policy INPUT ACCEPT
```
To change it back use
```ruby 
$ iptables --policy INPUT DROP
```
